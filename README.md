In this project, I have created a analysis report and further created a R Shiny Dashboard and deployed it on server of R Shiny.

# Data
Comprehensive Country information covering a wide range of indicators and attributes
Kaggle Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset

# Tools used
R, GGplot2, R Shiny Dashboard

The main goal of this project is to explore and make sense of various indicators and characteristics of countries around the world. The website is designed to assist users in analyzing a dataset by visualizing and understanding different aspects of each country, such as their distribution and dependencies.

To achieve this, the site provides tools for three types of analysis:
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Multivariate Analysis

The website employs various visualization tools such as histograms, bar plots, pie charts, and box plots for univariate analysis, scatter plots for bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis to offer users a comprehensive and accessible way to explore and gain insights into global country data.

# Why I named the website as SphereVista!
I chose 'SphereVista' because it perfectly captures what my website is all about. The word 'Sphere' reflects the idea that I want to provide a complete and detailed view of global information. The term 'Vista' makes it clear that users can expect a wide and expansive visualisation when exploring the data. Together, it symbolizes that my platform is like a window to a broad and insightful world of information about countries worldwide.
